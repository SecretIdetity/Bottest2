# Bottest

A discord bot some games and useful stuff.     
Code is ok-ish I'd say.     
Use at your own risk.     
Yes it's all in one file (not true anymore :3).     

Invite with https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=902941380295405569&permissions=2150746112&scope=bot

Or host yourself:

To use it you need node.js (and probably npm too).     
Clone the files and run npm install once you installed node and npm.     
Then just use node index.js to start the bot.      
**You need both config.json and data.json to use the bot.**     
You can find example configs named with _ex.

Use csetup.js to setup slash commands (Credit due?? i forgor).

I most likely will include .js file validation in the future.        
I will await Canvas to be supported in Worker Threads so that it can render Images in the Background.
